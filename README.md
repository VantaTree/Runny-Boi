# Runny-Boi
My very first proper game

RunnyBoi.pyw is the main file you need to run. Or the executable file.(only for linux)

Unfortunatly I could not add an executable for windows as it was over the size limit.
But You can dowload it from google drive ---> https://drive.google.com/file/d/13qURoM2WTCdHAAxbzTzz-VnFkzLdQHzu/view?usp=sharing

all executables are V1.1 (latest: V1.2)

Version 1.2:
Added aditional support for mouse, on screen controls and ui pause menu button.
The position of ui controls can be change to Left, Right, None.
